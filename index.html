  <br>
  <u>When a lock lights up red, an error code is written into the card.</u> <br>
(Please note this is only for the red light that lasts a few seconds) <br>
(If it is a green light plus 3 beeps (only with staff keys), means it's low battery) <br>
(If it is 5 quick red blinks, that means it's low battery and will Not write an error code) <br>
(If it is a very quick feint red blink, every few seconds, that means a item is detected but Not readable) <br><br>
Once you get the single red light for a few seconds <br>
Take that card back to the front desk and read it via the ALV2 PC Server Software <br>
(Click Read Guest card or Read Management Card).<br>
Look for the Error Type. Based on that, certain actions can be taken to fix the lock<br></br>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAZFNYJSmeo" target="_blank">For Video CLICK HERE - What to do if lock lights up red (for about 1 second) & doesn't allow access to room </a> <br><br>

Common Error Types:<br></br>
<u>Out of Staying Period-</u> <br> Means the card is either past or too early for it's allowed stay in the room. <br>
(For this situation usually guest keys Do not work, but the staff keys Still work on the room) <br>
Date and Time may be off too. Usually reprogramming it fixes the issue, see L1 which is above this question.<br><br>

<u>0x13 Out of time with guest-</u> <br>  Happens on common doors, means the guest is trying to enter a common door <br>
past the time period set which allows guests to use it, such as trying to go to a pool past the allowed time <br>
If you need to change the parameters of when guests are allowed, reprogram it and adjust the guest valid time<br><br>

<u>Out of Room Range-</u><br>   (Usually happens with common doors) <br>
If it is a guest key having the issue, It means the room range needs to be reset, <br>
Reprogramminging the lock with the correct room range usually fixes the issue ( See Question L1 above this question)<br>
(Room Range is the lowest and the highest room numbers in your property and everything inbetween that the lock will allow access<br>
If it is a staff key having the issue, then check the staff members authority to enter certain doors<br>
(Look at Question S2 Below for the part that says Add Authority for the staff member)<br><br>
<u>Inappropriate Sequence-</u><br> (If it is a guest key) -This means a newer card made under the same room # and used on the lock, disabling the previous issued card.<br>
You can either clear the locks' sequence using your DTU programmer (Look at Question L5) or issue the guest a new key  <br>
To avoid this error: You should issue a duplicate key instead of a new key if you're adding an extra guest to a room that is already occupied <br>
(If it is a staff key) A newer card was made under the same person's account and used on the lock. <br>
You can either clear the locks' sequence using your DTU programmer (Look at Question L5) or issue a New Card under the same staff member's account (Look at Question S1)<br><br>
<u> Mismatched Room # </u> - <br> The Key was used on the wrong room #. 
<br><br>
<u> Unacceptable shared use (issue date) </u> - <br> A newer key (that has the same main room and secondary room) was used on the door, cancelling out the previously made key.<br>
You'll have to re-issue (as new) the key that stopped working, or make a Duplicate of that newer key with the same main room and secondary room.
<br><br>
<u> Deadbolt in Use </u> - <br>The guest has the deadbolt activated on the room <br> 
If you need staff emergency access, you can issue a staff key and check the Deadbolt Override box, see S1 for issuing staff keys <br><br>
<u> MLO Active </u> - <br> A lockout card was used on the lock, Issue a cancel card and use it on the lock (Also see Question L8 Below) <br><br>
<u> Shutout Effective </u> - <br> (blinks red 3 times) This means when a guest card was issued for this room, the Shutout Checkbox was selected.<br>
The Shutout feature disables other cards from working on the room, and only allows the guest card with it's room # to have access<br>
To fix this, create a New Guest Card for that room # and make sure the Shutout Checkbox is Not selected. <br>
Use the New Guest Card you just created on that room, and then try your other keys afterwards <br><br>
<u> Unsupported Card (0X0E) </u> - <br>
A guest card was attempted to be used in a Non-Guest Room <br> <br>

<u> Hotel Code Error </u> - <br> The lock either has not been programmed yet or it has been programmed with another property's programmer <br>
Every propety is assigned a unique hotel code, once a lock is programmed, it is locked to that hotel code. <br> 
The  key created by the front desk must have a matching hotel code to the lock to be accepted.
<br><br>

<u> Unacceptable Time Frame 0x1A </u> - <br>
Usually happens with one-shot cards or maintenance cards, it means the date and time on the lock is way off and it cannot accept the card. It should be re-programmed to the correct date and time.<br> <br>

<u> 0x20 Invalid date with sms year month day </u> - <br>
The submaster card has expired, you will need to increase it's expiration date and re-issue it <br> <br>

<u> 0x16 Invalid card has used </u> - <br>
Usually happens with a guest key that was disabled on a common door, via the Cancel Card <br> <br>
	

<u> 0x42 detect battery near end </u> - <br>
The employee key was set up to not work if the door is low battery. To remove this setting go to management, submastercard, and uncheck the box that says <br>
Not unlock when battery near end, then reissue the card as a duplicate <br><br>

<u> 0x09 Write error in audit trail </u> - <br>
There was an error when the card reader tried to write the error code into the card or fob.  <br>
Try using the card or fob to get a red light again and try reading it in the front desk encoder once more<br>
If its still having an the same error, the card reader may not working normally anymore and is to be replaced <br> <br>

<u> 0x12 Mismatch special doorflag </u> - <br>
The card used doesn't have permission to enter that special door <br>
Permission can be granted through the front desk PC Miwa,  Setup, Submaster,  the check the box for the special room and re-issue the key <br><br>

<u> 0x12 Mismatch nonguest door flag </u> - <br>
The staff card used isnt allowed to enter the non-guest door  <br>
Due to the checkbox of that nonguestdoor room number Not being selected on the ALV2 Setup, Submaster Menu <br>
reprogram the nonguest door to be one which the staff card has a nonguest door checkbox selected, or add a checkbox  <br>
for that room number to that submaster account and re-issue the card <br><br>

	
<u> 0x21 Out of time period with SMS </u> - <br>
The submaster key was scheduled to only work during certain hours of the day. To change settings on which hours it works, go to the ALV2 PC Server <br>
Log in as a Manager and click Setup, Staff Settings and look for start and end for that person's account. There you can adjust the time. <br>
If you do not see the account there, go to Setup, Submaster instead and look for the the Start and End times. <br>
The date/time might also be off on the doorlock itself, you could try reprogramming it via question L1 above <br>
<br><br>


<u> Monitor door ajar </u> - <br>
This means the monitor door ajar box was selected when programming the lock. <br>
a staff key will work once, then stop working<br>
reprogram the lock and make sure the monitor door ajar box is Not selected, then try your staff key multiple times <br>
to confirm that door works again <br><br>
--- <br><br>
<u>If the lock blinks red 5 times</u> and doesn't allow access to room- <br>The batteries are low and need to be replaced (Look at Question L4 below) <br><br>
<u>If the lock blinks red 6 times and green 6 times </u>  but still allows access- <br>The date and time is off, it should be reprogrammed (Look at Question L1 above)<br><br>
<u>If the lock lights up green 1 time and beeps 3 times (only with employee key) </u>  and allows access- <br> The lock is starting to run out of battery but still works

  <u>Understanding Sequences:</u><br> 
Whenever you make a card or batch of cards, a sequence number is assigned to them.<br> 
When you make a New Issue on the same guest room, or staff member's account, a higher level sequence number is assigned to it<br> 
When you use the newer card on a lock, it will no longer accept any lower sequence or older cards, thus the sequence error<br> 
To avoid sequence error, you make a duplicate card in order not to assign a higher sequence number and disable the previous card<br> 
Also note that batches of cards, i.e. 10 cards made as a set have identical sequence numbers and will not cancel each other out <br> <br>
  
   *** Clearing the sequence Requires you have a DTU card with you<br> 
 <u> If you lost your DTU Card-</u> you can make a new one from the Front Desk ALV2 PC Server<br> 
  Log in as a manager, and click on Management, click on the DTU Card.<br> 
  Make sure the Duplicate box is Checked, and issue the card.<br> 
  You'll have to use a management key<br>

Typical Battery life for the ALV2 locks should be about 1 year. (Suggested battery replacement should be every 9-10 months) <br>
If you are experiencing that the battery life runs out way earlier than that - <br> 
 Card Reader (green circuit board inside) should be replaced.<br>
There is a slim or wide circuit board, depending on which door locks you have <br>
 Look at Question PA1 and PA2 Below for a guide on replacing the reader <br>
 The new reader installed needs to be reprogrammed <br><br>
*If there is still battery drain after replacing green circuitboard, then the Mortise needs to be replaced and/or the battery holder<br>
Look at Question PA3 and PA4 Below for a guide on replacing the mortise <br>
 Call our office if you need to order another card reader or mortise <br>
	<br>
	---<br>
	<br>
	If this is for a <u>Hilton</u> property with battery drain issues only on the Back of the House (Staff Only) doors<br>
the software on the card readers may have to changed <br>
This issue may be caused by the lock not having a Bluetooth Module attached to it (circled in Red), as most BOH locks do not have it<br>
we can assist through the phone with changing the software using the DTU Tablet programmer<br>
	<img src="H-BLE Module.jpg" alt="legacyp" hspace="8" style="width:170px;height:220px;"><br>
	---<br>
	<br>
	If this is a <u>Residential</u> property (Non-Hotel) and you purchased your locks before mid 2020, <br>
check if the mortise inside your locks has a black plastic coating in it's wires. <br>
If it does, it requires a white harness. Without the harness, the battery will drain<br><br>
*if it has a clear coating, it's a newer model and the harness is Not needed<br>

Troubleshooting:  <br>
If the card reader lights up red for about 1 second when a key is used, then it may be a programming issue. Try reprogramming the reader <br>
If the card reader doesn't light up at all, check it's power supply to see if it has a light and is on. <br>
If you have the same exact setup somewhere else, try exchanging the power supply or card reader to see if the issue transfers over <br>
If the card reader lights up green and responds to keys, but the locking device doesn't unlock, then try replacing the locking device <br>
Also keep in mind the extension wire which connects the power supply to the card reader and also the locking device needs to be checked <br>
Before you set these up, I suggest you set it up on a table with the reader and locking device directly connected to the power supply, <br>
that way you can test using a key and seeing if the locking device works, before you install anything on the wall <br>

-------------------Front Desk PC------------------Main Server (in the Server Room)------------------Digiswitch------ <br><br>
	
How Miwa(ALV2 PC Server) and onQ work together: <br><br>
The onQ software on the front desk is used to issue keys.  <br>
onQ software prompts a issuing command to the Miwa key making software (ALV2 PC Server), <br>
and it allows staff to make keys for guests and managers.<br>
The Front Desk PC's are connected to the Main Miwa Server(has white Keylock Interface sticker) on the property's Server/PBX Room. <br>
The Main Miwa Server is connected to Hilton's Digiswitch on port 8. <br><br> <br>
	
<img src="Must be signed in.png" alt="legacyp" hspace="8" style="width:450px;height:450px;">
 <br>
In order for onQ to be able to issue keys- <br> 
The Main Miwa Server (located in your hotel's Server Room) must always be on, and have the ALV2 PC Server software running  (it's ok even if logged off, as long as the software is open) <br><br>
	
<img src="Disconnect on ALV2 PC Server.png" alt="legacyp" hspace="8" style="width:450px;height:450px;"> <br>
Otherwise the Front Desk PC's will show disconnected on the ALV2 software and will not be able to make keys through onQ.<br> <br>

(Error 4c) --------------------------------------(Comm. Failure) ----------------------------------------(Error 9028) <br>
There are some errors that may occur when installing the room # <br><br>

-Deadbolt is activated, make sure the deadbolt is retracted when installing the room # <br>
-Error 9028 or 904C Payload not accepted, you'll need a new payload from Miwa  <br>
-Error A001- Get a new Auth code from Hilton <br>
-Error 90DC- device maintenance required, battery 165%- try reinstalling Miwa firmware or disconnect from power or battery for 30 sec. <br>
-Unable to send info, maybe try installing again <br><br>

If your still have issues <br>
Create a Cancel card from your Front desk ALV2 PC Server (Management, Cancel Card), then use it on the lock <br>
Also reprogram the lock via the Miwa Tablet (Question L1 on top)<br>
Then Try reinstalling the digital key room # (via directkey toolkit) again <br>
Otherwise the digital key bluetooth module on the lock may have to be replaced <br>
(it's good to have spare digital key bluetooth modules in your office just incase) <br>
